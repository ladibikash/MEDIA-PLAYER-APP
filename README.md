## The Media Player App is an Android-based mobile application developed using Java in Android Studio, designed to play audio files stored on the user's device. This app serves as a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly tool for users to manage and enjoy their music collection. With a clean interface and essential playback controls, the Media Player App provides an experience similar to that of a traditional MP3 player, tailored for modern smartphones.

At its core, the app allows users to browse audio files, select a song, and play, pause, stop, or skip tracks using intuitive controls. It makes use of Androidâ€™s built-in MediaPlayer API, which provides the functionality needed to play media files in various formats like MP3, WAV, and AAC. The app scans the device's internal and external storage to retrieve a list of available audio files and displays them using a RecyclerView for a smooth and scrollable UI.

The project is structured around standard Android components:

MainActivity handles the primary user interface, which includes the list of songs and playback controls.

A custom adapter populates the list of songs in a RecyclerView.

Playback logic is handled using the MediaPlayer class in Java, which manages audio streaming and resource handling.

The UI is built using XML and adheres to material design principles. Users can easily play a selected song with a single tap and control playback using buttons like Play, Pause, Next, and Previous. A SeekBar is also included to show the current progress of the track and allow manual scrubbing.

To manage resources efficiently, the app properly handles the media player lifecycle. For instance, the MediaPlayer object is released when the activity is destroyed or when a new track is played to prevent memory leaks and application crashes. Background audio playback can also be integrated using Services, allowing users to listen to music while using other apps.

The app uses runtime permissions to access media files from storage (as per Android 6.0+ requirements), ensuring that it complies with privacy and security standards.

Key technologies and components used:

Java: Core programming language.

Android Studio: Development environment.

MediaPlayer API: To handle audio playback.

RecyclerView: For listing songs.

SeekBar & UI Controls: For interactive playback control.

ContentResolver: To access media files from device storage.

Potential future enhancements for the app include:

Adding playlist creation and song categorization (e.g., by artist, genre).

Supporting background playback using foreground services and notifications.

Implementing a dark mode or customizable themes.

Enabling streaming from online sources (e.g., using ExoPlayer).

Displaying album art, track metadata, and lyrics.

In conclusion, the Media Player App is a functional and accessible music playback solution developed with Java in Android Studio. It not only demonstrates the capabilities of Android's media APIs but also serves as a solid foundation for more complex multimedia applications.
